## Printing to Screen

The easiest way to print text to the screen at this stage is the [VGA text buffer]. It is a special memory area mapped to the VGA hardware that contains the contents displayed on screen. It normally consists of 25 lines that each contain 80 character cells. Each character cell displays an ASCII character with some foreground and background colors. The screen output looks like this:

We will discuss the exact layout of the VGA buffer in the next post, where we write a first small driver for it. For printing “Hello World!”, we just need to know that the buffer is located at address `0xb8000` and that each character cell consists of an ASCII byte and a color byte.

The implementation looks like this:

```rust
static HELLO: &[u8] = b"Hello World!";

#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    let vga_buffer = 0xb8000 as *mut u8;

    for (i, &byte) in HELLO.iter().enumerate() {
        unsafe {
            *vga_buffer.offset(i as isize * 2) = byte;
            *vga_buffer.offset(i as isize * 2 + 1) = 0xb;
        }
    }

    loop {}
}
```

First, we cast the integer `0xb8000` into a [raw pointer]. Then we [iterate] over the bytes of the [static] `HELLO` [byte string]. We use the [`enumerate`] method to additionally get a running variable `i`. In the body of the for loop, we use the [`offset`] method to write the string byte and the corresponding color byte (`0xb` is a light cyan).

Note that there's an [`unsafe`] block around all memory writes. The reason is that the Rust compiler can't prove that the raw pointers we create are valid. They could point anywhere and lead to data corruption. By putting them into an `unsafe` block, we're basically telling the compiler that we are absolutely sure that the operations are valid. Note that an `unsafe` block does not turn off Rust's safety checks. It only allows you to do [five additional things].

I want to emphasize that **this is not the way we want to do things in Rust!** It's very easy to mess up when working with raw pointers inside unsafe blocks. For example, we could easily write beyond the buffer's end if we're not careful.

So we want to minimize the use of `unsafe` as much as possible. Rust gives us the ability to do this by creating safe abstractions. For example, we could create a VGA buffer type that encapsulates all unsafety and ensures that it is _impossible_ to do anything wrong from the outside. This way, we would only need minimal amounts of `unsafe` code and can be sure that we don't violate [memory safety]. We will create such a safe VGA buffer abstraction in the next post.
