In this section we discuss the linker errors that occur on Linux, Windows, and macOS, and explain how to solve them by passing additional arguments to the linker. Note that the executable format and the linker differ between operating systems, so that a different set of arguments is required for each system.

#### Linux

On Linux the following linker error occurs (shortened):

```
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1
  |
  = note: "cc" […]
  = note: /usr/lib/gcc/../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: In function `_start':
          (.text+0x12): undefined reference to `__libc_csu_fini'
          /usr/lib/gcc/../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: In function `_start':
          (.text+0x19): undefined reference to `__libc_csu_init'
          /usr/lib/gcc/../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: In function `_start':
          (.text+0x25): undefined reference to `__libc_start_main'
          collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

The problem is that the linker includes the startup routine of the C runtime by default, which is also called `_start`. It requires some symbols of the C standard library `libc` that we don't include due to the `no_std` attribute, therefore the linker can't resolve these references. To solve this, we can tell the linker that it should not link the C startup routine by passing the `-nostartfiles` flag.

One way to pass linker attributes via cargo is the `cargo rustc` command. The command behaves exactly like `cargo build`, but allows to pass options to `rustc`, the underlying Rust compiler. `rustc` has the `-C link-arg` flag, which passes an argument to the linker. Combined, our new build command looks like this:

```
cargo rustc -- -C link-arg=-nostartfiles
```

Now our crate builds as a freestanding executable on Linux!

We didn't need to specify the name of our entry point function explicitly since the linker looks for a function with the name `_start` by default.

#### Windows

On Windows, a different linker error occurs (shortened):

```
error: linking with `link.exe` failed: exit code: 1561
  |
  = note: "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\…\\link.exe" […]
  = note: LINK : fatal error LNK1561: entry point must be defined
```

The "entry point must be defined" error means that the linker can't find the entry point. On Windows, the default entry point name [depends on the used subsystem][windows-subsystems]. For the `CONSOLE` subsystem, the linker looks for a function named `mainCRTStartup` and for the `WINDOWS` subsystem, it looks for a function named `WinMainCRTStartup`. To override the default and tell the linker to look for our `_start` function instead, we can pass an `/ENTRY` argument to the linker:

[windows-subsystems]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/entry-entry-point-symbol

```
cargo rustc -- -C link-arg=/ENTRY:_start
```

From the different argument format we clearly see that the Windows linker is a completely different program than the Linux linker.

Now a different linker error occurs:

```
error: linking with `link.exe` failed: exit code: 1221
  |
  = note: "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\…\\link.exe" […]
  = note: LINK : fatal error LNK1221: a subsystem can't be inferred and must be
          defined
```

This error occurs because Windows executables can use different [subsystems][windows-subsystems]. For normal programs, they are inferred depending on the entry point name: If the entry point is named `main`, the `CONSOLE` subsystem is used, and if the entry point is named `WinMain`, the `WINDOWS` subsystem is used. Since our `_start` function has a different name, we need to specify the subsystem explicitly:

```
cargo rustc -- -C link-args="/ENTRY:_start /SUBSYSTEM:console"
```

We use the `CONSOLE` subsystem here, but the `WINDOWS` subsystem would work too. Instead of passing `-C link-arg` multiple times, we use `-C link-args` which takes a space separated list of arguments.

With this command, our executable should build successfully on Windows.

#### macOS

On macOS, the following linker error occurs (shortened):

```
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1
  |
  = note: "cc" […]
  = note: ld: entry point (_main) undefined. for architecture x86_64
          clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 […]
```

This error message tells us that the linker can't find an entry point function with the default name `main` (for some reason, all functions are prefixed with a `_` on macOS). To set the entry point to our `_start` function, we pass the `-e` linker argument:

```
cargo rustc -- -C link-args="-e __start"
```

The `-e` flag specifies the name of the entry point function. Since all functions have an additional `_` prefix on macOS, we need to set the entry point to `__start` instead of `_start`.

Now the following linker error occurs:

```
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1
  |
  = note: "cc" […]
  = note: ld: dynamic main executables must link with libSystem.dylib
          for architecture x86_64
          clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 […]
```

macOS [does not officially support statically linked binaries] and requires programs to link the `libSystem` library by default. To override this and link a static binary, we pass the `-static` flag to the linker:

[does not officially support statically linked binaries]: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1118/_index.html

```
cargo rustc -- -C link-args="-e __start -static"
```

This still does not suffice, as a third linker error occurs:

```
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1
  |
  = note: "cc" […]
  = note: ld: library not found for -lcrt0.o
          clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 […]
```

This error occurs because programs on macOS link to `crt0` (“C runtime zero”) by default. This is similar to the error we had on Linux and can also be solved by adding the `-nostartfiles` linker argument:

```
cargo rustc -- -C link-args="-e __start -static -nostartfiles"
```

Now our program should build successfully on macOS.

#### Unifying the Build Commands

Right now we have different build commands depending on the host platform, which is not ideal. To avoid this, we can create a file named `.cargo/config.toml` that contains the platform-specific arguments:

```toml
# in .cargo/config.toml

[target.'cfg(target_os = "linux")']
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-nostartfiles"]

[target.'cfg(target_os = "windows")']
rustflags = ["-C", "link-args=/ENTRY:_start /SUBSYSTEM:console"]

[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")']
rustflags = ["-C", "link-args=-e __start -static -nostartfiles"]
```

The `rustflags` key contains arguments that are automatically added to every invocation of `rustc`. For more information on the `.cargo/config.toml` file, check out the [official documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html).

Now our program should be buildable on all three platforms with a simple `cargo build`.

#### Should You Do This?

While it's possible to build a freestanding executable for Linux, Windows, and macOS, it's probably not a good idea. The reason is that our executable still expects various things, for example that a stack is initialized when the `_start` function is called. Without the C runtime, some of these requirements might not be fulfilled, which might cause our program to fail, e.g. through a segmentation fault.

If you want to create a minimal binary that runs on top of an existing operating system, including `libc` and setting the `#[start]` attribute as described [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.16.0/book/no-stdlib.html) is probably a better idea.
