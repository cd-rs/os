# Course Description 

## Advanced Systems Computing

A semester-long study of computer architecture and organization, information management, networking and communication, operating systems, or parallel and distributed computing that applies or extends the content of CS 271 or more advanced classes.

## Operating Systems

This course studies design and implementation of operating systems. Beginning with a bare metal binary, students will iteratively implement a minimal operating system kernel on an emulated embedded system using a systems programming language such as Rust or C. Students will scientifically examine the hardware/software interface through topics such as memory management, processes, context switches, kernels, interrupts, system calls, and signals.

In Spring 2025, the course will be conducted in Rust, though students are welcome to complete the coursework in C or Zig under their own self-direction pending individual approval from the course instructor.

# About Me

Calvin Deutschbein is an assistant professor of computer science.

# Required Materials {#required-materials .unnumbered}

Required materials for a given class will be available on the [course
webpage](https://cd-public.github.io/). All course materials will
be made available at no cost to the student.

## Supplementary Text 

[Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) will be provided to students in electronic copy.

[Writing a Hypervisor in 1,000 Lines](https://seiya.me/blog/hypervisor-in-1000-lines) is a helpful supplementary text.

# Accessability 

I will make every effort to ensure all coursework and materials are
accessible to all students, including working with on-campus
specialists. However, there is always room for improvement. I always
appreciate hearing from students about how I can make the course more
accessible, so please reach out if there is something I can be doing
better!

# Course Objectives {#course-objectives .unnumbered}

-   Implement a computer systems in a compiled, non-garbage collected language.

-   Design, implement, and apply computing solutions to actual existing problems using linear, hierarchical, and associative data structures without reliance on external libraries.

-   Learn modern development practices in a state-of-the-art coding framework specific to systems computing.

-   Utilize the command line and command line tools to create executables that target a variety of architectures with varying degrees of library support.

-   Become familiar with security-relevant design and implementation decisions when developing a computer system.

-   Survey number, set, graph, and automata theory in an applied setting.

# Course Structure 

The course will be composed of lecture, labs, and hoemwork on systems
computing.

## Class Structure 

Classes are scheduled for Monday and Wednesday at 13:10 PM. The lecture
schedule is on the [course webpage](https://cd-rs.github.io/os).

### Midterm

There will be an in-class code-based midterm, which will be
"open-everything\" (except other students).

### Final

The final is the release of an open-source operating system maintained under version control. 

## Feedback and Grading {#feedback-and-grading .unnumbered}

### Grading Scale {#grading-scale .unnumbered}

We will vote in the first week of class whether to use ungrading or specification grading. Both candidates will be covered in the first class and voted on by students.

# Course Policies

## Collaboration Policy 

All collaboration is by mutual enthusiastic consent. Any collaboration
is permitted on homeworks and labs, none on the midterm, and partners on
the final. This will conducted via honor system unless I receive a
(anonymous) student complaint.

## AI Policy

Use of anything considered AI is allowed but not recommended. I've tried using it and thought it was horrible. There are variety of good tools that actually work I would recommend instead, beginning with the tools installed in the first week of class.

## College Policies 

The following material is adapted from "Information for Syllabus"
recommended language on syllabus prepartion provided to instructors in
the College of Arts & Sciences.

### Academic Integrity

Students of Willamette University are members of a community that values
excellence and integrity in every aspect of life. As such, we expect all
community members to live up to the highest standards of personal,
ethical, and moral conduct. Students are expected not to engage in any
type of academic or intellectually dishonest practice and encouraged to
display honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility in all
they do. Plagiarism and cheating are especially offensive to the
integrity of courses in which they occur and against the College
community as a whole. These acts involve intellectual dishonesty,
deception, and fraud, which inhibit the honest exchange of ideas.
Plagiarism and cheating may be grounds for failure in the course and/or
dismissal from the College.

### Commitment to Positive Sexual Ethics 

Willamette is a community committed to fostering safe, productive
learning environments, and we value ethical sexual behaviors and
standards. Title IX and our school policy prohibit discrimination on the
basis of sex, which regards sexual misconduct --- including
discrimination, harassment, domestic and dating violence, sexual
assault, and stalking. We understand that sexual violence can undermine
students' academic success, and we encourage affected students to talk
to someone about their experiences and get the support they need.

### Diversity and Disability Statement 

Willamette University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed
to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. My goal is to
create a learning environment that is usable, equitable, inclusive and
welcoming. If there are aspects of the instruction or design of this
course that result in barriers to your inclusion or accurate assessment
or achievement, please notify me as soon as possible. Students with
disabilities are also encouraged to contact the Accessible Education

Accessible-info@willamette.edu to discuss a range of options to removing
barriers in the course, including accommodations.

### Religious Practice 

Willamette University recognizes the value of religious practice and
strives to accommodate students' commitment to their religious
traditions whenever possible. Please let me know within the first two
weeks of the semester if a conflict between holy days or other religious
practice and full participation in the course is anticipated. I will do
my best to work with you to determine a reasonable accommodation.

*As an instructor, I will exercise my discretion to offer accomodations
for conflicts after the first two weeks of the semester. You may always
reach out to me, including retroactively, though the quality of the
accomodation I am able to offer may improve given advanced warning!*

### SOAR Center Offerings: Food, Clothing, and School Materials
